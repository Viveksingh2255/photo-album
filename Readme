- CSS is used for responsive layout and styling
- Images are stored in the `images/` directory with unique filenames
- The application validates image file types (.jpg, .jpeg, .png) and size (max 5MB)

## Limitations

- Only .jpg, .jpeg, and .png image formats are supported
- Maximum file size is set to 5MB
- No image editing or resizing functionality

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Make sure the `images/` directory exists and is writable by the web server
2. Check that PHP is properly installed and configured on your web server
3. Ensure your web server supports file uploads and the upload_max_filesize in php.ini is sufficient
